    "body": "<p>Long disappointing and downtrodden, eurozone stocks and the corresponding exchange traded funds&nbsp;are rebounding this year.</p>\n<p>As Feb. 5, the <strong>iShares MSCI Eurozone ETF</strong> (CBOE: EZU) and the <strong>SPDR Euro STOXX 50 ETF</strong> (NYSE: <a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/fez#NYSE\">FEZ</a>) are up an average of 7 percent year-to-date.</p>\n<h3>What Happened</h3>\n<p>While 2019 is still in its formative stages, the starts to the year by EZU and FEZ are undoubtedly impressive following an average 2018 loss of just over 17 percent for the funds, which are two of the largest U.S.-listed eurozone ETFs.</p>\n<p>As previous eras of upside for eurozone equities have taught investors, regional risks linger and continued upside for EZU, FEZ and rival ETFs this year may not be easy to come by.</p>\n<p>Recession talk has been a familiar eurozone refrain for several years, and some data points seem to confirm that at least some of the region&#39;s economies are on the cusp of economic contraction.</p>\n<h3>Why It&#39;s Important</h3>\n<p>&ldquo;Driven initially by a slowdown in exports, eurozone growth weakened markedly through 2018, culminating in a 1.2-percent&nbsp;year-over-year&nbsp;increase in GDP in Q4, the weakest pace of expansion in almost five years,&rdquo; <a href=\"https://ihsmarkit.com/research-analysis/is-eurozone-heading-recession.html\">according to IHS Markit</a>.</p>\n<p>Growth in Germany, the region&#39;s largest economy, is expected to slightly outpace that of the broader eurozone. EZU devotes 27.54 percent of its weight to German stocks. FEZ has a 27.63-percent weight to Germany.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;A positive effect from fiscal stimulus measures in Germany, France and Italy has also been factored in,&rdquo; said Markit. &ldquo;But even with a decent start to this year, we forecast a significant slowdown in annual eurozone GDP growth in 2019 and 2020 to 1.2 percent&nbsp;and 1 percent, respectively, based on our preliminary estimates for February&#39;s forecast round.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>France and Italy are the eurozone&#39;s second- and third-largest economies, respectively. France is by far the largest country weight in both EZU and FEZ.</p>\n<h3>What&#39;s Next</h3>\n<p>There is also the issue of volatility with eurozone equities and funds. In every year from 2013 to 2018, the <strong>iShares Europe ETF </strong>(NYSE: <a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/iev#NYSE\">IEV</a>), a diversified Europe fund, was less volatile than EZU and FEZ. Rising eurozone recession risk would likely prompt an uptick in equity market volatility there.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The key medium-term risk to the eurozone from an external perspective is probably a hard landing for the global economy, given the unusually long U.S. economic expansion currently and policy challenges, on the fiscal side particularly. China&#39;s rebalancing is an additional concern,&rdquo; according to Markit.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>Related Links:</em></p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/trading-ideas/long-ideas/19/02/13115189/put-the-clamps-on-emerging-market-volatility-with-this-etf#/null\">Avoid EM Volatility With This ETF</a></em></p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/trading-ideas/long-ideas/19/02/13115766/communication-services-the-china-way\">An Exciting China Sector ETF</a></em></p>\n",

So <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/insider-trades\">insider buying</a> can be an encouraging signal for potential investors, particularly during periods of uncertainty.</p>\n<p>Here&#39;s a look at a few significant insider purchases reported in the past week, and note that a beneficial owner also made sizable purchases of <strong>Seagate Technology PLC</strong> (NASDAQ: <a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/stx#NASDAQ\">STX</a>) shares.</p>\n<h3>Post Holdings</h3>\n<p><strong>Post Holdings Inc</strong> (NYSE: <a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/post#NYSE\">POST</a>) saw a director step up to the buy window midweek. At per-share prices that ranged from $95.09 to $97.10, the more than 134,000 shares reportedly acquired cost over $12.96 million. That followed that director&#39;s option exercised on 1.25 million shares earlier in the week.</p>\n<p>The recent earnings beat resulted in an <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/19/02/13091261/wells-fargo-raises-post-holdings-price-target-after-q1-\">analyst upgrade for Post</a>. The stock ended the week at $98.05 per share, which was above the director&#39;s listed purchase price range. Shares have traded as high as $102.78 in the past year, but the consensus price target was at $111.50 on last look.</p>\n<h3>Kinder Morgan</h3>\n<p>The <strong>Kinder Morgan Inc</strong> (NYSE: <a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/kmi#NYSE\">KMI</a>) executive chair of the board, Richard Kinder, has purchased 600,000 more shares of this Houston-based energy infrastructure giant.

The stock closed Friday at $29.55 per share, which is within the above purchase price range. While the analysts&#39; consensus target was last seen at $34.00, the stock has traded as high as $37.81 in the past 52 weeks.</p>\n<h3>JPMorgan</h3>\n<p>After several executives sold <strong>JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.</strong> (NYSE: <a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/jpm#NYSE\">JPM</a>) stock at the end of January, one director purchased 5,000 shares last week. At about $103.79 apiece, that director&#39;s acquisition totaled less than $520,000 and brought the director&#39;s stake to about 26,300 shares.</p>\n<p>This financial giant is among companies that would be affected by efforts to <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/19/02/13092849/chuck-schumer-bernie-sanders-urge-limit-on-corporate-buybacks\">limit share buybacks</a>. Its share price pulled back last week and closed most recently at $101.36, below the director&#39;s purchase price. The stock has traded between $91.11 and $119.33 in the past 52 weeks, and analysts currently see the price going as high as $116.24.</p>\n",

    "title": "Earnings Potpourri: Coca-Cola, Deere, Cisco Report This Week, But Trade Talks Dominate",
    "teaser": "It&rsquo;s nearly 7,000 miles from Washington to Beijing, but investors might need to keep their eyes peeled on both cities this week.",
    "body": "<p>It&rsquo;s nearly 7,000 miles from Washington to Beijing, but investors might need to keep their eyes peeled on both cities this week.</p>\n<p>Plenty of earnings action lies ahead (see more below), but for now it appears that two sets of talks&mdash;one in China and the other in Washington&mdash;could dominate the news. Any fresh developments on either border security or China trade negotiations could potentially spark buying or selling activity on Wall Street as the week goes by. Friday is the deadline for a Washington deal to prevent another shutdown.</p>\n<p>Overseas markets climbed early Monday and U.S. indices also moved higher in pre-market trading amid optimism about possible progress in U.S. talks with China, which start later this week in Beijing. The deadline for new U.S. tariffs is the beginning of March. On the negative side, there were news reports that U.S. warships had sailed near a disputed island chain in the South China Sea. So there&rsquo;s a bit of a dichotomy between positive and negative on the U.S./China front.</p>\n<p>There just aren&rsquo;t many numbers this week, so a lot of trade could be driven by rumor. That means it&rsquo;s possible we&rsquo;ll see more intraday volatility than normal, much of it on thin volume. Anyone trading the markets might want to consider the chance for possible whipsaw action.</p>\n<h3>The &ldquo;Two Faces&rdquo; of Wall Street</h3>\n<p>After a political opponent called him &ldquo;two faced,&rdquo; Abraham Lincoln joked that if he had two faces, &ldquo;Why would I wear this one?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Well, the stock market arguably had two faces last week. Until Wednesday, it looked like its recent winning ways might continue. Major indices marched steadily upward amid better than expected earnings, hopes for a resolution to the trade war with China, and the glow from another high-flying jobs report. Volatility sank to three-month lows as worries generally eased, and the S&amp;P 500 Index (SPX) hit two-month highs.</p>\n<p>All that changed starting mid-week. New worries surfaced about China, a potential government shutdown, troubles in Europe, and some less than outstanding U.S. economic data. Combined, these concerns appeared to team up against the free spirits that helped lift sentiment Monday and Tuesday. &nbsp;Volatility, as measured by the VIX, shot back up. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ($DJI) just barely managed to eke out its seventh-straight week of gains. So did the Nasdaq (COMP). However, the SPX closed Friday down 1% from its closing high for the week posted Tuesday.</p>\n<p>So the question heading into the new week appears to be which market shows up. It&rsquo;s possible that even if things improve, volatility could remain elevated as Friday&rsquo;s deadline for another government shutdown approaches and talks take place between the U.S. and China. There might be some good reasons for investors to consider staying on their toes considering how geopolitics continue to loom over Wall Street.</p>\n<h3>Is Inflation Still MIA?</h3>\n<p>Whatever happens in China or Washington, there&rsquo;s a smattering of data to mull this week. High on the list are consumer and producer prices for January&mdash;due Wednesday and Thursday, respectively. The Fed may have hit the brakes on rate hikes, but the economy has still seen strong jobs growth. That means the Fed could be carefully watching these inflation metrics, though it&rsquo;s said to most closely watch personal consumption expenditure prices (PCE) due March 1.</p>\n<p>Last time out, neither consumer nor producer prices appeared to hint at any creeping signs of inflation, with the core consumer price index rising 0.2% and core producer prices actually falling 0.1%. We&rsquo;ll preview the January numbers later this week.</p>\n<p>Then there&rsquo;s the delayed retail sales report for December, due Thursday. As you might recall, this is one of the data points we didn&rsquo;t get last month due to the government shutdown. Retail sales growth was pretty strong most of last year, but December&rsquo;s data might reveal if the stock market dive that month had any impact on consumer shopping.</p>\n<p>Also, overseas data might make a splash as investors await gross domestic product (GDP) updates from Germany and Japan. More on that tomorrow.</p>\n<h3>Yield Flags Waving</h3>\n<p>One potential concern heading into the new week is U.S. Treasury yields. The 10-year yield fell to 2.63% by late Friday, its lowest level since the start of the month. It appears that some investors are once again embracing what some say are &ldquo;less risky&rdquo; parts of the market, though no investment is truly safe.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The dollar index&mdash;another measure often watched for signs of investors fleeing risk&mdash;also stayed well above 96 early Monday after falling below 95.5 earlier this month. That might be one to consider watching, because in recent months a climbing dollar has often corresponded with falling stocks. If weakness in Europe&rsquo;s economy persists, one analyst told TD Ameritrade Network late last week, that might lend the greenback even more traction. The 10-year German Bund yield dropped below 0.1% Friday but bounced back a bit early Monday.</p>\n<p>Another thing that might get some attention this week is the re-opening of China&rsquo;s markets after a one-week holiday. Until today, the major indices there haven&rsquo;t had a chance to react to any of the recent developments on the U.S./China trade front. Early Monday, Chinese markets moved higher amid hopes for progress in trade talks, media outlets reported.</p>\n<p>Turning back home, it&rsquo;s been a pretty impressive rally since those Christmas Eve lows, with both large and small-caps charging back even when you take last week&rsquo;s late selling into account. The rally has brought valuations back toward their long-term average, but now we&rsquo;re coming up against some key developments outside of the market&rsquo;s control.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>One school of thought suggests that until the tariff situation and the fight in Washington get resolved, markets might struggle to find new upside. That doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean the rally is over, only that stocks might be hunting around for catalysts with earnings season starting to wind down.</p>\n<p>From a sector standpoint, leaders last week included utilities, info tech, and industrials&mdash;kind of an eclectic mix of both cyclical and defensive areas. Energy came in at the bottom of the standings, with other laggards including materials and financials.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"2019-02-11-chart.jpg\" src=\"/files/u142941/2019-02-11-chart.jpg\" style=\"height:418px; width:780px\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Figure 1: Turn Up the Heat:</strong> The utilities sector (candlestick) took the checkered flag to lead all sectors last week, maybe a sign of some investors seeking &ldquo;defensive&rdquo; places to put their money. Meanwhile, energy (purple line), took a dive as economic worries bit into crude prices.

Past performance does not guarantee future results. &nbsp;</em></p>\n<p><strong>A Sprinkle of Earnings</strong>: Some of the reports investors might want to catch this week include <strong>Activision Blizzard</strong> (NASDAQ: <a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/atvi#NASDAQ\">ATVI</a>), <strong>Cisco Systems, Inc.&nbsp;</strong>(NASDAQ: <a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/csco#NASDAQ\">CSCO</a>), <strong>The&nbsp;</strong><strong>Coca-Cola Co&nbsp;</strong>(NYSE: <a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/ko#NYSE\">KO</a>), <strong>Deere &amp; Company&nbsp;</strong>(NYSE: <a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/de#NYSE\">DE</a>), and Chinese technology company <strong>Baidu.com Inc </strong>(NASDAQ: <a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/bidu#NASDAQ\">BIDU</a>). ATVI could give more insight into the video game market after last week&rsquo;s disappointing forecasts from industry competitors. CSCO&mdash;which beat analysts&rsquo; earnings and revenue estimates last time out&mdash;could be interesting to watch for any new guidance on how potential tariffs might affect it if a deal between China and the U.S. can&rsquo;t be reached. The same might be said for DE.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>KO shares got a lift late last year in part because some investors began turning toward so-called &ldquo;defensive names,&rdquo; amid the market turmoil, and the company also upped prices and saw better diet drink sales in the summer quarter. Investors might want to check whether the company&rsquo;s diet pop sales continued to bubble higher in Q4.</p>\n<p><strong>Q4 Earnings Performance Right About Average:</strong> Earnings season is far from over, though many of the biggest names are now behind us. See below for a look at some of the key companies expected to report this week and what investors might want to consider as they watch results pour in. To date, 71% of S&amp;P 500 companies have beaten analysts&rsquo; Q4 earnings estimates, equal to the five-year average, FactSet said.</p>\n<p>Also, 62% of S&amp;P 500 companies have beaten Wall Street&rsquo;s estimates for Q4, up slightly from the five-year average of 60%, according to FactSet. Average S&amp;P 500 earnings growth is 13.3%, and revenue growth is 7%, with all 11 S&amp;P 500 sectors reporting revenue growth. If earnings keep up the current performance, it would be the fifth-straight quarter of double-digit earnings growth, FactSet said. However, many analysts are looking for flat or even negative earnings growth in Q1.</p>\n<p><strong>Long Wait For GDP Data</strong>: After a lengthy delay due to the shutdown, it looks like the government will ultimately release Q4 gross domestic product (GDP) data at the end of February (barring another shutdown). Until then, we can only look to analyst estimates, and they vary. According to the Atlanta Fed&rsquo;s GDPNow indicator, GDP rose 2.7% in Q4, which would be down from 3.4% in Q3 and 4.2% in Q2. The GDPNow projection is pretty close to the average estimate among Wall Street analysts, and might reflect solid consumer and government spending, according to research firm CFRA. Weakness could come from residential investment, inventories, and net exports. Some market watchers expect slightly better than 3% GDP growth, and a solid number like that might help back up the robust consumer health seen in Q4 earnings reports. If things look weaker than expected, it wouldn&rsquo;t be too surprising if that partially reflects softness in the housing and automobile markets, as well as falling energy prices.</p>\n<p><em>Information from TDA is not intended to be investment advice or construed as a recommendation or endorsement of any particular investment or investment strategy, and is for illustrative purposes only.

    "body": "<p>The tight supply of commercial drivers, and of team drivers in particular, is pinching expedited transportation company <strong>Forward Air Corporation</strong>, (NASDAQ: <a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/fwrd#NASDAQ\">FWRD</a>) the company&#39;s top two executives said today.</p>\n<p>The Greeneville, Tenn.-based company, which yesterday posted solid fourth quarter and full-year 2018 results &ndash; achieving records across various metrics &ndash; is feeling the escalating costs of purchased transportation. About 25.9 percent of its fourth quarter tractor usage in its core expedited less-than-truckload (LTL) business was sourced from third-parties, up from about 21 percent in 2017. The balance of the company&#39;s fleet comes from owner-operators who effectively work exclusively for Forward Air.</p>\n<p>Purchased transport expenses for expedited LTL in the fourth quarter rose about $4.7 million from the year-earlier period, the company reported. Across its four units &ndash; which also include truckload, intermodal and pool distribution &ndash; fourth-quarter purchased transportation costs rose $7 million year-over-year.</p>\n<p>&quot;Purchased transport is tight, especially for teams,&quot; said CFO Michael J. Morris on an analyst call. &quot;It is still a challenge to get them.&quot;</p>\n<p>Team driver availability is critical to a company like Forward Air, which provides time-definite services across fairly long lengths-of-haul. The average distance of its expedited LTL runs in 2017 was 650 miles, according to Benjamin J. Hartford, analyst for Baird, an investment firm. With the electronic logging device (ELD) mandate in many cases capping solo drivers&#39; daily runs at 400-500 miles, teams are often necessary to fulfill Forward Air&#39;s delivery requirements while ensuring that drivers operate within the regulations.</p>\n<p>As difficult as it has been to find qualified solo drivers, it is even harder to find teams &ndash; especially at wages that carriers are accustomed to paying. Because the ELD mandate has made them more valuable, teams can typically command six-figure annual salaries. Teams are also scarcer because not every duo is cut out to share a rig for days at a time.</p>\n<p>Forward Air reported a 4.2 percent fourth-quarter tonnage decline in the LTL segment. Morris and Tom Schmitt, the company&#39;s president and CEO, blamed the decline in part on tough comparables from the 2017 fourth quarter when volumes were strong. The difficult year-on-year comparisons will likely carry over into the first quarter of 2019, the executives predicted. January LTL tonnage rose 1.6 percent over the same period in 2018, the company said. Yields on the LTL traffic were strong, the executives said.</p>\n<p>Within the LTL segment, the company&#39;s airport-to-airport business, where it moves goods between 90 terminals located at or around U.S. airports, reported lower tonnage. That was offset by gains in its door-to-door business, although the airport business is the larger of the two sub-segments.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.freightwaves.com/transparency19/\"><img alt=\"Don't miss it.

Morris added that a &quot;game plan&quot; has been developed for M&amp;A activity, especially in intermodal &ndash; which had a strong fourth quarter with an 18.8 percent year-over-year revenue gain and a 7.3 percent shipment count increase &ndash; and in final mile.</p>\n<p>Forward Air has budgeted for a &quot;healthy amount&quot; of capital expenditures for 2019, with the focus on information technology investments rather than in the physical plant, Morris added.</p>\n<p>Schmitt, who will add the chairman title in May when Bruce A. Campbell, the current chairman, retires, said the company will be announcing new accessorial charges &ndash; fees separate from the basic line-haul &ndash; rate adjustments and fuel surcharge changes in the March to May time frame. Schmitt strongly hinted at higher charges for moving oversized shipments, saying the company is &quot;not competitive in what we charge&quot; for big, bulky shipments.</p>\n<p>Forward Air&#39;s quarterly and 2018 results got a warm reception today from investors and traders in an otherwise down equity market. Shares closed at $64.52 a share, up $5.77 a share.</p>\n<p><a class=\"sqs-block-button-element--medium sqs-block-button-element\" href=\"https://www.freightwaves.com/subscribe-1\">Want more content like this?

We do not want general fund transfers anymore.&quot;</p>\n<p>Because the Highway Trust Fund has had to resort to such transfers to keep it solvent, railroads contend, the trucking industry has been given an unfair cost advantage in competing for freight.

    "body": "<p>This week, the U.S. and China try, yet again, to resolve their trade differences before a March 1 deadline that will mark the official start of higher tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese imports. The U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin are travelling to Beijing to meet with China&#39;s Vice Premier Liu He. Those preparatory talks are to set ground work for a late February summit between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping to settle the nearly one-year trade war that has already disrupted businesses spanning soybean farms to Chinese factories.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But while the two biggest economies may be taking a hit, other countries stand to benefit from the ongoing dispute. A report from the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) says the trade dispute is not benefitting either the U.S. or China, but rather the &quot;bystander nations . . . that will profit by capturing some of the diverted exports of the trade giants.</p>\n<p>The European Union is one beneficiary of the trade war, according to UNCTAD. The EU is likely to capture about $70 billion of U.S.-China trade, with $50 billion of Chinese exports to the U.S., and $20 billion of US exports to China. Mexico would be able to capture $27 billion of new business with the U.S., which represents about 6% of the country&#39;s total exports. Australia, Brazil, India, Philippines, Pakistan and Vietnam are also expected to see substantial increases in their exports.</p>\n<p>UNCTAD Director Pamela Coke-Hamilton says &quot;this suggests that while unilaterally imposed tariffs are very effective in deterring trade from rival countries, they are very ineffective in protecting domestic firms, both in China and the U.S.&quot;</p>\n<p>Import gateways in the U.S. are already seeing the effects of these swaps in the supply chain. Bethann&nbsp;Rooney, Assistant Director of the Port of New York &amp; New Jersey, says the third busiest U.S. port<strong> </strong>saw cargo substitution over 2018 due to the tariffs. &quot;The cargo exports that would have normally gone to China ended up going to other countries such as India and Indonesia.

The trade lane will see an increase in capacity of 1.1 million twenty-foot equivalent units set to be introduced to the region. Many of those ships will be in the 18,000-teu range, which &quot;will add significant capacity to the 120 ships aggregating 1.8 million teu already in operation on these routes.&quot; The result is that an already over-supplied market will continue to be &quot;challenging&quot; for liner operators. Spot rates for shipping from Asia to North Europe are already down 22 percent from their September peak. But the liner operators could use slow vessel speeds and also cancel some sailings to mitigate the rate weakness, Savvides reports.</p>\n<p><a class=\"sqs-block-button-element--medium sqs-block-button-element\" href=\"https://www.freightwaves.com/subscribe-1\">Want more content like this?

Yet getting women to follow in her footsteps remains elusive. A FedEx study of 1,000 women in Canada found that only 11 percent were interested in entering the industry despite it overlapping into e-commerce and other sectors that have a sexier cache.</p>\n<p>&quot;More disappointing is that more than 50 percent said they weren&#39;t interested, but didn&#39;t know a lot about it,&quot; Carere told the Memphis Commercial Appeal. FedEx, she told the paper, has a &quot;great opportunity&quot; to bring more women into the transport workforce.</p>\n<p>FedEx has placed more women in leadership positions that most companies in the field.

That&#39;s because there is no money to do it. After mandatory entitlements like Social Security and Medicare, debt service, military needs, and social programs like welfare and food stamps, the cupboard for other federal initiatives, no matter how significant, is essentially bare. With no political appetite to raise federal motor fuels taxes, and a vehicle miles-travelled tax a pipe dream, there is one increasingly viable option: Privatize all of the country&#39;s federally-owned transport assets. The devil is very much in the details, but given the fiscal condition of the U.S., is there any other strategic choice?</p>\n<p><a class=\"sqs-block-button-element--medium sqs-block-button-element\" href=\"https://www.freightwaves.com/subscribe-1\">Want more content like this?

    "teaser": "An anticipated recommendation by the World Health Organization (WHO) calling for the international rescheduling of &ldquo;marijuana&rdquo; and derivative products is poised to be a watershed moment with implications to be observed throughout global markets.",
    "body": "<p>An anticipated recommendation by the World Health Organization (WHO) calling for the international rescheduling of &ldquo;marijuana&rdquo; and derivative products is poised to be a watershed moment with implications to be observed throughout global markets.</p>\n<p>If an <a href=\"https://www.marijuanamoment.net/read-the-world-health-organizations-marijuana-rescheduling-recommendations/\">unconfirmed leak</a> of a WHO document reported February 1 by a cannabis legalization activist and journalist* is accurate, United Nations (UN) global health experts next month will advocate for whole-plant marijuana and cannabis resin to be rescheduled from a Schedule IV classification (the most restrictive as defined within a 1961 international drug convention), and for delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and related isomers to be completely removed from a separate 1971 international drug treaty.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/who-recommends-rescheduling-cannabis-international-law-first-time-history-1324613\">proposed rescheduling</a> would de-emphasize marijuana and resins to Schedule I (the lowest level of international restrictions), and would remove altogether CBD having THC levels below 0.2%. Cannabis tinctures and extracts would also be designated as Schedule I. (Note: That designation contrasts with classification under the U.S. Controlled Substances Act of 1970 [CSA], in which Schedule I is the most restrictive level).</p>\n<p>Currently, New Frontier Data estimates that there are 272 million cannabis consumers globally, reflecting the strong demand and widespread use of cannabis worldwide.</p>\n<p>The rescheduling of cannabis products would accelerate the pace of global cannabis reform. Currently, more than 60 countries allow for some form of legalized medical, adult-use, or industrial cannabis production or research activities. Countries which have previously resisted reform efforts for fear of international repercussions would be encouraged toward developing domestic cannabis industries and expanding international trade between newly opened markets.</p>\n<p>The global hemp industry would also expand in both scope and influence. Based on data in <a href=\"https://newfrontierdata.com/product/stateofhemp/\"><em>The Global State of Hemp 2019 Industry Outlook</em></a> (released tomorrow), the de-scheduling of hemp-derived CBD would lend economic accelerant to a market already afire: As detailed in the report, global CBD sales in 2018 are estimated beyond $800 million, with the overall global hemp market forecast to expand at a 17.5% rate through 2020. By removing industrial hemp-based CBD products from any scheduling, look for the pace of global growth to quicken, and for more countries to utilize hemp to provide economic development.</p>\n<p>The proposed changes by the WHO would also significantly affect the U.S. medical, adult-use, and industrial markets. By having the world&rsquo;s leading health organization endorse health-related benefits to cannabis, U.S. regulators, legislators, and other policymakers would be hard-pressed to justify the current CSA scheduling, which asserts there being no medicinal value in cannabis and continues a policy that prioritizes the most punitive penalties for cannabis violations. Pressure for legislative and regulatory reform is already underway given Canada&rsquo;s nationwide program and Mexico&rsquo;s judicial repeal of prohibition.</p>\n<p>That noted, much remains to be <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/sarabrittanysomerset/2019/02/05/is-the-un-world-health-orgs-recommending-to-globally-reschedule-cannabis-much-ado-about-nothing/#3a529db11404\">decided</a>: Member states of the UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs (CND) originally expected to receive the recommendations from WHO&rsquo;s Expert Committee on Drug Dependence (ECDD) in December 2018, before they were delayed to CND&rsquo;s annual meeting next month. Now, however, there is <a href=\"https://cannabisnow.com/the-hidden-problem-with-the-whos-reclassification-of-cannabis/\">conjecture </a>that the ECDD recommendations may not be presented until sometime in 2020 to offer additional time for their consideration by member states.</p>\n<p>Despite the presence of unknowns, and however they flurry across the landscape, New Frontier Data will continue (here, and through our latest <a href=\"https://newfrontierdata.com/products-services/analyst-reports-3/\">reports</a>) to share the most solidly comprehensive research and insights available to the legal cannabis industry.

Bitcoin added 7.8% to its value marking the biggest leap to the upside since the December 28. Moreover, the bull rally revived the hope that Bitcoin has the ability to correct towards $3,800 and even touch $4,000 in the short-term.</p>\n<p>The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization broke out of the falling wedge pattern that had been limiting recovery in the past three weeks. Consequently, Bitcoin trading volume spiked 54.6% to a record $7.73 billion as the data on CoinMarketCap on Friday 8. The volume had not surpassed these levels since December 24, besides it is the highest level in the last three months. The volume is averaging at $6 billion in the last three days.</p>\n<p>The downside is currently strongly rooted above both the 4-hour 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) and the 100-day SMA. Technical indicators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is holding position at the highest level since December 19. The RSI currently sits at 61.29 after retreating from the overbought zone. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is still in the positive region despite the correction from the highs of $3,711.</p>\n<p>Bitcoin is seen&nbsp;trading at $3,591 at press time following a 1.57% lower correction on the day. As mentioned, technical levels are still positive which means that Bitcoin upside correction is far from over. The breakout is still supported by the high trading volumes and we could see it make progress towards $3,800 and eventually make a grand gesture heading to $4,000 psychological hurdle.</p>\n<h3>BTC/USD 4-hour chart</h3>\n<p><img alt=\"btc_usd_1-636854862438052978.png\" src=\"/files/u142941/btc_usd_1-636854862438052978.png\" style=\"height:244px; width:800px\" /></p>\n",

    "body": "<ul>\n<li><strong>ETH/USD brings joy to the market and takes the lead.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>BTC/USD takes positions for continued bullishness.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>XRP/USD plays at absent-mindedness but manages to stay in the game.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The weekly series of technical articles covering the Top 3 <a href=\"https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies\">Cryptocurrencies </a>begins with the market in a situation that I <a href=\"https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/news/top-3-price-prediction-bitcoin-ripple-ethereum-crucial-hours-before-takeoff-countdown-in-progress-201902081020\">previously mentioned</a> as possible throughout the week. In several of my pieces, I expressed the sensation that we could see <a href=\"https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/news/expectations-bullish-sentiment-for-btc-usd-bitcoin-reacts-and-shows-its-upward-power-201902081543\">substantial price increases</a>, although I also exposed the necessary conditions so that those increases could be consolidated.</p>\n<p>At the end of the American session on Friday, the <a href=\"https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/resources/brokers-best-cryptocurrencies-exchanges\">crypto exchanges</a> grids were spectacularly painted in green, highlighting the <a href=\"https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/litecoin\">Litecoin </a>with rises above 35% in some moments. The weekend left the subject on standby and today, in the opening of the Asian market we see profit collection.</p>\n<p>For now, we are reaching key support levels in the short term. These are price levels considered &quot;positive&quot; since if they are respected, in many cases, they become levels where stop orders proliferate.</p>\n<p>In general, it seems that the consolidation process is going to be slow and at least during today&#39;s day the market may show weakness, but in the middle of the week, we can see again strong bullish activity.</p>\n<h3>BTC/USD 240 Minute Chart</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.fxstreet.com/rates-charts/btcusd\">BTC/USD</a> is currently trading at the $3,592 price level after leaving the high of $3,707. The current price level is right at a concentration of congestion support price essential for development in the short term.</p>\n<p>Above the current price, the first target is at the $3,690 price level (price congestion resistance and downstream channel ceiling). On the bullish side, this resistance is the most important in weeks. Overcoming it would free the BTC/USD from the bearish environment and put it in a much more positive scenario. The second bullish target is at $3,900 (price congestion resistance). The third bullish target is at $4,050 (price congestion resistance). The level from which the movement could accelerate a lot is at $4,200 (price congestion resistance).</p>\n<p>Below the current price, the first support level is at $3,590 (price congestion support). Below this support level, we find an accumulation of moving averages (EMA50, SMA100, and SMA200) until we reach the next level of price congestion support at $3,465. Given the strength of the price support, a break down would be a signal of extreme weakness. In that case, the short-term bearish target would be around $3,200 (base of the bearish channel).</p>\n<p><img alt=\"1btc_usd_76-636854790781794674.png\" src=\"/files/u142941/1btc_usd_76-636854790781794674.png\" style=\"height:391px; width:800px\" /></p>\n<p>The MACD shows a bearish cross profile after Friday&#39;s strong move. It rose quickly and now it is time to normalize things. In these extreme situations, the MACD loses reliability as the price may continue to rise even though the lines are pointing down.</p>\n<p>The DMI helps us see the magnitude of the rise we saw at the end of the week. The bulls reached positive levels not seen in more than six months, while the bears went to minimum levels but already seen on each occasion that the market has insinuated upward movements. It is clear that the bears do not bail anything out and that none of them wants to get caught if the bulls take out the upside strength they have inside.</p>\n<h3>ETH/USD 240 Minute Chart</h3>\n<p>The ETH/USD pair is currently trading at $108.13, leaving the intraday high at $110.27. The early morning movement of the European session has allowed the <a href=\"https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/ethereum\">Ethereum </a>to surpass the EMA50 and for a moment the SMA100. This is an excellent demonstration of bullish strength.</p>\n<p>If <a href=\"https://www.fxstreet.com/rates-charts/ethusd\">ETH/USD</a> manages to close the current candle above the SMA100, the crucial next objective is at the $120 (SMA200) price level, as an intermediate level towards the third level of price congestion resistance at $131.</p>\n<p>Below the current price, the first support level is at the EMA50 at $106.65, while the second support level is at $105.5 (price congestion support). The third level of support is at $103 (price congestion support).</p>\n<p><img alt=\"eth_usd_63-636854791143679869.png\" src=\"/files/u142941/eth_usd_63-636854791143679869.png\" style=\"height:397px; width:800px\" /></p>\n<p>The MACD on the 4-hour chart has gained momentum, although the opening between the lines is minimal. It is necessary to follow the evolution carefully to see if it can overcome the 0 levels of the indicator.</p>\n<p>The DMI on the 4-hour chart looks much better than the BTC/USD pair. The bulls have managed to surpass the level of the bears and are shooting at levels not seen since late last December.</p>\n<h3>XRP/USD 240 Minute Chart</h3>\n<p>The XRP/USD is currently trading at the $0.302 price level. The achievement of the XRP in Friday&#39;s move is to go past the $0.30 level, which allows it to remain in a potentially bullish zone, but nothing more. In this respect, the XRP&#39;s behavior is disappointing as much more was expected from it. If a few weeks ago I highlighted its strength to pierce upward levels, in this new momentum precisely stands out on the contrary and is the only one among the Top 3 that does not manage to exceed all moving averages.</p>\n<p>Above the current price, the first resistance level is $0.308 (price congestion resistance). The second resistance level is at $0.316 (SMA200), while the third level is at $0.334 (price congestion resistance). The XRP would enter bullish mode above the $0.39 price level (price congestion resistance).</p>\n<p>Below the current price, XRP/USD has first level support at $0.30 (price congestion support), then second level support at $0.293 (price congestion support) and last level support at $0.288 (price congestion support).</p>\n<p><img alt=\"xrp_usd_68-636854791506033924.png\" src=\"/files/u142941/xrp_usd_68-636854791506033924.png\" style=\"height:370px; width:800px\" /></p>\n<p>MACD shows a more advanced development than both <a href=\"https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/bitcoin\">Bitcoin </a>and Ethereum. It is crossed downwards at a point where it usually happens that it crosses up again. We could see new rises at the end of the week.</p>\n<p>The DMI is a reflection of the situation we see in the price. Bears stay above the ADX line, which gives it upside potential. The bulls, on the other hand, seem to dare to stand against the bullish side of the XRP and increase their level of activity.</p>\n",

    "body": "<p><strong>Tesla Inc</strong> (NASDAQ: <a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/tsla#NASDAQ\">TSLA</a>) CEO Elon Musk has never been one to take hits lying down. In response to <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/19/02/13242032/teslas-stock-drops-after-sec-asks-to-hold-elon-musk-in-contempt-over-another-twe\">accusations</a> by the Securities and Exchange Commission that he violated their fraud settlement, Musk <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/12/elon-musks-lawyers-shoot-down-sec-lawsuit.html\">cried foul</a>.</p>\n<p>&quot;The Securities and Exchange Commission&#39;s request that Musk be held in civil contempt for a single, immaterial tweet that dutifully complied with [a court-ordered settlement] is incorrect on the facts and on the law,&quot; his lawyers said in a late Monday <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/elon-musk-sec-contempt-response-1552373427-29cbf4e2-73f9-4fac-903b-12bd0a4c3023.html?dlbk\">court filing</a>.</p>\n<h3><strong>What Happened</strong></h3>\n<p>In February, the SEC moved to hold Musk in contempt of court. Under their <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/18/10/12513849/tesla-trades-higher-after-judge-approves-musks-sec-settlement\">fall settlement</a>, Tesla lawyers were supposed to monitor all Musk&rsquo;s tweets deemed material to the stock, but they didn&rsquo;t review a Feb. 19 tweet about production projections. Today, they maintain such oversight was unnecessary.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The tweet was simply Musk&rsquo;s shorthand gloss on and entirely consistent with prior public disclosures detailing Tesla&rsquo;s anticipated production volume,&rdquo; Tesla lawyers&nbsp;wrote in the court response. &ldquo;Moreover, it is clear from the context of the tweet that it was celebratory and forward-looking&mdash;a type of statement that courts have concluded is immaterial as a matter of law.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Musk&rsquo;s team accused the SEC of &ldquo;trampling&rdquo; on First Amendment rights in a strategy that &ldquo;smacks of retaliation and censorship.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Undeterred, and perhaps embarrassed by Musk&rsquo;s criticism of it, the SEC urges the court to read and apply the order in an unconstitutional manner,&rdquo; they wrote.</p>\n<h3><strong>Why It&rsquo;s Important</strong></h3>\n<p>Tesla traded down 1.5 percent Tuesday morning, although its risks of losing the legal battle are yet unknown. The SEC has not proposed a punishment for Musk, and <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/teslas-elon-musk-rebuts-secs-motion-to-hold-him-in-contempt-11552357175?dlbk\">some say</a> his role as CEO remains secure.</p>\n<p>Regardless of the immediate consequences, Musk may remain a subject of SEC scrutiny for some time. The pair have <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/18/12/12822777/musk-has-no-respect-for-sec-says-tweets-arent-being-reviewed\">long feuded</a> over their respective boundaries, and Musk continues to provoke the regulator&rsquo;s ire even after the contempt filing.</p>\n<p>U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan will rule on the SEC&rsquo;s contempt motion, but the stakes for Musk remain unclear.</p>\n<p>Tesla&#39;s stock closed Monday at $290.92 per share.</p>\n<p><em>Related Links:</em></p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/19/02/13246390/analysts-react-to-sec-action-against-elon-musk\">Analysts React To SEC Action Against Elon Musk</a></em></p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/19/03/13335099/tilson-vs-left-short-sellers-place-10-000-bet-on-teslas\">Tilson Vs.
